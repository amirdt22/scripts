scripts
=======

Little (shell) scripts I sometimes use

set_ops.sh:		  perform set operations (union, intersection, subtraction) on text files
histogram.sh:		print a historgram of STDIN
screen.sh:		  start or resume a screen session
crypt.sh:		    prints out the crypted string
_dig:		        does a DNS lookup with the short name
_xdig:		      reverse DNS lookup for our IP range
wr:		          add a line to my weekly report
